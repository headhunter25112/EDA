# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Projects Repository

Welcome to my collection of Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) projects! This repository serves as a showcase of my skills in data exploration, visualization, and pattern discovery. Here, you'll find a variety of projects, demonstrating my ability to extract meaningful insights from diverse datasets.

## What's Inside

This repository is organized into folders, each representing a distinct EDA project. You'll find:

* **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing:**
    * Projects demonstrating my ability to handle missing data, outliers, and data transformations.
    * Examples may include cleaning messy datasets, standardizing data formats, or handling categorical variables.
* **Data Visualization:**
    * Projects focused on creating insightful visualizations using libraries like Matplotlib, Seaborn, or Plotly (in Python), or similar tools.
    * Examples may include histograms, scatter plots, box plots, and interactive dashboards.
* **Statistical Analysis:**
    * Projects involving statistical tests, correlation analysis, and hypothesis testing.
    * Examples may include identifying significant relationships between variables or performing A/B testing.
* **Feature Engineering:**
    * Projects demonstrating my ability to create new features from existing data to improve model performance.
    * Examples may include creating interaction features or extracting time-based features.
* **Specific Project Folders:**
    * Each project gets its own folder.
    * Inside each folder, you will find:
        * Jupyter Notebooks (.ipynb) or Python scripts (.py) containing the EDA code.
        * The datasets used in the analysis.
        * Any supporting documents, such as data dictionaries or project reports.
        * A README.md file specific to the project, describing the project goals, and findings.

## How to Use This Repository

1.  **Open the Jupyter Notebooks or Python scripts:**
    * Open the `.ipynb` files using Jupyter Notebook or JupyterLab.
2.  **Install the required libraries:**
    * Refer to the project-specific README files or the notebook/script for a list of required libraries.
    * You can typically install these using pip. Example: `pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn`

## Learning and Improvement

This repository is a live documentation of my EDA journey. I will continually add and refine projects as I improve my skills in data analysis and visualization.

Let's explore the world of data together!
